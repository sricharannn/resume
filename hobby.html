<body>
    <p>My actual
        hobby is reading thriller and fiction novels. My initial favorite authors are:
        <ul>
            <li>Robin Cook</li>
            <li>Sidney Sheldon</li>
        </ul>
        As of now, there are no favorite authors. Whichever book has good reviews, it will be in my
        Kindle's read list.<br />
        I wouldn't consider it a hobby, but watching movies occupies most of my free time.
        One day, I wish to write a story that would be made into a movie.<br />   
        This is my thid hobby. I write short stories as of now.
